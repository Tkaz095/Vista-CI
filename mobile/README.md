# Vista CI Mobile

The Flutter client for Vista CI.

## Recommended: cloud build + Genymotion

Use the **Android APK** GitHub Actions workflow to build the app, then download the APK and drag it into Genymotion. This avoids installing another Android NDK on your workstation. See [the cloud build guide](../docs/android-cloud-build.md) for the first run, architecture selection, and signing limitations.

## Run locally (requires the Android build toolchain)

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Firebase Core is configured for Android with project `vista-ci` and package ID `com.vista.vista_mobile`. The Android Google Services Gradle plugin reads `android/app/google-services.json`; `main.dart` initializes Firebase before starting the app.

Authentication, Firestore, and notifications still need to be configured. iOS Firebase setup is not included yet; run on an Android device or emulator for this milestone.
